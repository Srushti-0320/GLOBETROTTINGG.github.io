## 🛠 Projects

### *Globetrotting*  

*OVERVIEW:* 
Overview of Tour Package Management System (TPMS) for Design and Analysis of Algorithms:
1. Objective:
Develop an efficient system to manage tour packages, focusing on optimization, cost-effectiveness, and user satisfaction.
2. Modules:
Customer Management: Handles user registration, login, and profile management.
Package Management: Manages details of tour packages, including destinations, prices, and itineraries.
Booking System: Supports real-time booking and payment processes.
Feedback System: Collects user feedback for improvement.
3. Algorithmic Focus:
Shortest Path Algorithm: Optimizes travel routes (e.g., Dijkstra, A*).
Dynamic Programming: Used for cost optimization of package deals.
Sorting and Searching: Efficient retrieval and sorting of packages.
Greedy Algorithms: For maximizing bookings or resource allocation.
4. Design Goals:
Scalability: Handle growing user demands and package diversity.
Performance: Minimize response time for search and booking.
Reliability: Ensure system uptime and data accuracy.
5. Data Structures:
Graphs for route optimization.
Hash tables for quick user and package lookups.
Arrays/Lists for managing package details.
6. Challenges:
Balancing user preferences with cost and availability.
Real-time updates for bookings and cancellations.
7. Outcome: A robust, algorithm-driven TPMS that enhances

*Technical Stack:*  
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

*Impact:* 
1. Customer Experience:
Streamlined booking process.
